### Hola, I'am Rola 👋
I'm a front end web react developer, I have always passionate about coding and programming, and this has funded my special interest in web development. I always seek additional knowledge when it comes to technology and learning new techniques. Thus, I have been involved in several online courses and projects to improve my skills in the field.
